# 42diploma

Launch : run `npm run start` in front directory and `go run .` in back folder

With this project, students from 42 school can easily see what level they will end up when doing available projects.

Doing this project, we used the 42 api, learned a bit of Golang and focused on communication between ourselves.

Frontend is not particularly finished as the end point of the project was the start of ashishae's internship.

Done by thervieu and ashishae.
