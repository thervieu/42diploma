# 42diploma

## Launch

Create 42Api entry (localhost:3001 url)
`export CLIENT_ID=UID_GIVEN_BY_42`
`export CLIENT_SECRET=SECRET_GIVEN_BY_42`

run `go run .` in back folder and once launched run `npm run start` in front directory.

With this project, students from 42 school can easily see what level they will end up when doing available projects.

Doing this project, we used the 42 api (auth), learned a bit of Go and worked with Material-UI.

Frontend is not particularly finished as the end point of the project was the start of Arseniy's internship.

Done by thervieu and ashishae.
